# IBM Data Science final project

Within this task, I was asked to tackle a full data science project for a problem of my choice.

The problem I chose was to understand which London borough would be the most appropriate for a renter searching for a new house. This decision would be based on three criteria detailed below:

- Safe to live in.
- Affordable for a possible first-time renter.
- Provides a selection of essential public services close by.

The code can be found within the project notebook, whilst a full report, explaining why certain decisions were made, is provided in pdf format in this repository. Finally, there is an accompanying presentation aimed to briefly explain the problem and results.
